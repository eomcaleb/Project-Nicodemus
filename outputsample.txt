okay let's turn to the word of god today man we are still in the book of judges last chapter last chapter georges chapter 21 verses 13 to 25. okay george's chapter 21 verses 13 to 25. all right very last portion of the book of judges let's read it oh together in one voice then the whole assembly sent an offer of peace to the benjamites at the rock of raymond so the benjamites returned at that time and were given the women of jebus gilead who had been spared but there were not enough for all of them the people grieved for benjamin because the lord had made a gap in the tribes of israel and the elders of the assembly said with the women of benjamin destroyed how shall we provide wives for the man who are left the benjamite survivors must have heirs they said so that a tribe of israel will not be wiped out we can't give them our daughters as wives since we israelites have taken this oath cursed be anyone who gives a wife to a benjamite but look there is the annual festival of the lord in shalom to the north of bethel and the east of the road that goes from bethel to shechem and to the south of lebona so they instructed the benjamites saying go and hide in the vineyards and watch when the girls of shiloh come out to join in the dancing then rush from the vineyards and each of you sees a wife from the girls of shiloh and go to the land of benjamin when the fathers or brothers complain to us we will say to them do us a kindness by helping them because we did not get wives for them during the war and you are innocent since you did not give your dollars to them so that is what the benjamites did while the girls were dancing each man caught one and carried her off to be his wife then they returned to their inheritance and rebuilt the towns and settled in them at that time the israelites left that place and went home to their tribes and clans each to his own inheritance in those days israel had no king everyone did as he saw fit amen let's pray lord we thank you thank you for your presence right here if only the bible was given to us without your presence without the inspiration without the teaching ministry of the holy spirit right here we would be really really we would go could go so wild in our human centered interpretation or twisted with our twisted mind thank you for your presence your spirit is teaching us with god who is guiding us revealing your truth to us as we pay attention to your world so teach us your truth god as we look into this ancient event that took place like three thousand three thousand years ago yes you will teach us how to live today successfully the same god who was the king of israel then even though they did not acknowledge you so teach us your truth lord let us enjoy a successful prosperous year new year in your eyes successful and prosperous in your eyes lord as we do all things that are written in your world in jesus name we pray amen so today is the january 2nd okay second second day of the new year happy new year everybody happy new year yes let's talk to each other say happy new year that's a kind of yes happy new year yes that was kind of a kind of kind of a tricky request yeah i made for you to do but yeah happy new year indeed yeah i really really wish you guys are happy new year yeah how can we make this year uh happy one or happier happier than 2021 uh if we keep doing the same thing as we did last year chances are we will end up spending another year so a year that is as bad or as good maybe as last year not much better than last year if we keep doing the same thing this year right and this new year will be the same old life same old life until we really change so the title is new year with the same old life until real transformation until real transformation yeah for the israelites a new year when i speak i feel kind of strange because i i beat my tongue very very hard a couple of days ago i shared very briefly at the lnd yes so it's very very hard so it's still healing so if my if kind of a what's that yes if my pronunciation comes kind of weird weirder than usual then please understand yeah that's that's why um yeah for the israelites a new year with with a better life would not come until they had a king and started learning to do as the king's fit but in those days as the the author of the book of judges wrote in those days the israelite had no king they had no king and everyone did as he saw fit for a period of about 300 years 300 years that that was the period of period of judges from joshua to samuel um 300 years which is far longer than a person's lifetime right yeah very rarely you know people live more than 100 years even then it's 300 years right three times so for those 300 years israelites may have said happy new year i know that uh how to say happy new year you're in hebrew even today here good good here good year so happy new year 300 times right 300 years means 300 times but their life didn't get happier because they didn't didn't have king they had they did not acknowledge the lord as their king so doing things as they saw fit or as they pleased in their own eyes not in the eyes of the lord they could not have a happy year for those 300 years we can just generalize it that way even though there were some times of peace some years of peace after god delivered israel from the oppression of a foreign nation through a judge but overall the period of the judges was quite dark how can we make this new year happier than last year no for us really how can we make it happier well pretty very simple decide to obey the lord more than ever before can you can you make the decision now if i'm gonna obey the lord more than ever before no matter what my mom says i'm going to obey the lord the more than ever before more than no matter what my supervisor says to me no matter what kind of evaluation i'm going to receive from work no matter what kind of look i'm going to receive from my friends i'm going to obey the lord more than ever before can you make the decision yeah that way you can make this year happier than last year i'm i'm sure well speaking of obedience think about our our psychology and god's reality when we decide to obey him so when we decide to obey god or when we say to god god i'll obey you what is happening what is happening two aspects our psychology and god's reality first determined the determination to obey god is made by us that is our psychological and spiritual choice we make our psychological and spiritual choice we make god i'm going to obey you but the actual strength and wisdom for us to obey god come from the spirit of god and that is god's reality right we don't we do not create the wisdom and strength to obey god but we can we can have that determination god i'm going to obey you but the actual strength to obey comes from god right that's god's reality we must understand this really yeah when we think about these two aspects of obedience now we have a better understanding of what it means when we say i will obey you god well i say i'll obey you god but the same thing actually when we obey leaders hebrews chapter 13 verse 17 obey your leaders and submit to the authority what well the obedience to human beings human leaders is already almost removed from the north american churches because it sounds so weird the critic or whatever so so much so much kind of a cultic uh there are so many so many happenings or some bad things that happened in the cult groups obedience to human leaders and then now evangelical churches overreacted to that no okay we'll completely remove the concept of obedience to human leaders okay let's be safe by doing that we just fail to make disciples it is still in the bible yeah why do you remove a biblical conceptual principle yeah in your in your overreaction to uh some bad happenings in a cult group why would you do that that's that's foolish anyways i will obey but let me put it early in this in this explanation uh let's just say obedience to god okay so when we decide to obey when we decide to obey we are not doing it because we have the actual strength and wisdom to do god's commandments when we decide to obey we do that because we trust in the lord to provide us with the necessary strength and wisdom to obey right isn't there isn't there what you do when you when you say you obey when you say i'm gonna obey you god yeah that's used to say that because you really trust in god to provide you with the strength and wisdom to obey not because you already have the strength and wisdom but many people don't want to say i will obey why because they think they must have that strength and wisdom already in them that's misunderstanding and that's pride pride based obedience concept and that's why we we don't like obedience so but if we don't like obedience that means directly means we don't want to trust in god to provide us with the strength and wisdom to obey right the same thing when we when we say okay when we say to our leader our discipler or church leader says yes i'll obey yeah i'll obey you i will trust uh i i i believe what you're teaching is really biblical teaching obey like that that again not because i have the strength and wisdom to obey but because i trust in the lord to provide me with the strength and wisdom to obey to this right thing god does not demand a promise or guarantee from us promise or guarantee that's what people do in this society when they do business right we demand a promise or guarantee or warranty from service providers so what like when when our mind is twisted and then when we have this misunderstanding about the biblical concept of obedience then when we say we uh yeah i'm gonna obey you god we feel like we have to give him a promise so i will obey you there is not is it's not a warranty it's not guarantee or promise it's just this decision to obey god and decision to trust in him to provide me with the necessary strength and wisdom to obey him to do the right thing that's it it's not a promise or guarantee but we take it that way again that is like treating god as our business partner okay you do i do business with you god so i i obey you i promise no it is not that god does not demand such things from us when we decide to obey so don't mistake don't make a mistake what god demands from us is trust trust so when we decide to obey we are giving him our trust trust in what trust in his resources part c our memory versus right his spirit his strength his faith his faithfulness you know you know better than me right his his peace his provision and his help in temptation those are god's resources and there are many more of course so we when we decide to obey god it means we are god we are giving god our trust trust in his resources his resources will assist us to successfully obey him that's how we do life of trust and obedience before the lord so don't don't even try to give god a promise is that a biblical concept can you find it in the bible in this thick book of the bible does does does any verse in the bible teach you to give a promise to god ever no vow maybe yeah make a vow even then you need we need a good knowledge according to gospel also so don't treat god that way really you are not that great in god you know god already knows what you have what you don't have your limitations and who are you to make such a guarantee before god you just simply tell him i'm gonna obey you lord i trust you yeah to give me strength that's it okay so give him all your trust trust in all his resources well if we are if we are not happy the number one reason is immaturity we are unhappy because we are immature really and if we are immature the number one reason is our disobedience in other words if we obey the lord we will grow mature and when we grow mature will be happier people in the lord then the key question is how do we obey the lord better how well it can be answered in many different ways but one key requirement is that we must understand the spiritual mechanism of obedience as i explained just now the decision to obey is made by us but the actual strength and wisdom to obey comes from god we must understand that then what is our job we decided to obey the lord and rely on his resources relying on god's resources that's not easy yeah that's another another whole world of spiritual art of living relying on god's resources people can memorize part c well we many of us have memorized part c right and people can have a bible study great bible study session on those verses read them in greek maybe maybe we can memorize them in greek use them as a theme verse for a retreat or conference relying on god's resources all those key verses like that or put them on your bumper stickers on your car or on your phone screen so you can be reminded of those key verses to rely on god like that we can do all that but still we can never learn to actually rely on god how long has it been since you first memorized those verses part c rely on god's resources how long has it been probably a few years many of you right but do you really know how to rely on god have we learned to rely on god we can listen to countless messages on those verses but never learn to rely i actually rely on god we keep relying on depending on our own resources not because it is better or easier it is never easy actually it might feel natural or it might be automatic automatically rely on ourselves our own resources but it is we don't do that because it is better or easier but because we don't know how to rely on god's resources if you don't know the alternative actually the alternative is a better alternative relying on god's resources but we don't know how to do that do we actually know how to rely on god's resources and that is another whole topic and all true disciples must master it as soon as possible if they really want a breakthrough in their life maybe you can make a new year's goal in that master the art of relying on god's resources so today's passage i kind of wished uh to finish the dark book of judges last year leaving it in 2021 but uh yeah that's that's our usual wish we want a fresh start without and yeah without lingering over the past set sorrowful past events yes past events are in the past but the problem is we are still the same that's the problem usually yeah as someone said uh life is ten percent what happens to us and ninety percent what how we reacted to it to it so if last year 2021 was not a good one then 10 just 10 of the reason was because life just didn't treat us well but 90 of the reason was because we reacted to life unwisely 90 percent that unwise person who reacted to life unwisely carries over into this new year and that's the problem the calendar year has changed but we are still the same same level of maturity or same level of immaturity the same immature person carries over into the new year so on what basis can we ever say happy new year so though really when we become really really sober and honest and think about all those years at the beginning of hitch we said happy new year and then how much how much i have become mature really and then wow every time i say happy new year i feel like it feels so pathetic really yeah so i guess so what one of the most lame wishes is happy new year perhaps we'd better say oh another year good luck maybe that's a better better yeah greeting at the beginning of the year but we have jesus of course we have jesus because of jesus happy new year yeah that's very very legit yes well of course just because jesus is jesus is present or jesus exists or jesus has overcome death and grave sin that doesn't mean we will rely on him better right just because second corinthians 12 9 exists doesn't mean we actually become strong in weakness right we need to learn to be how learn how to become strong in our weaknesses by relying on christ right so that's why we need to learn to rely on god's resources we ourselves must change that's why the word of god fundamentally teaches us the change of ourselves not just programs just cars or houses or our jackets you know well if you get a new jacket you might be happy for whatever one winter maybe yeah one one week i don't know so this year will be better than last year if we ourselves become better than last year becoming better means becoming mature yeah mature particularly in as we always pray right much in communication financial stewardship emotions and fitness among many areas yeah there are many many crucial very very important areas not so not not uh because these are more important but these are more practical and many people show weaknesses in these areas that's why i kind of nailed these four communications towards uh finance and emotion and fitness and they affect our emotions our life attitudes so much they kind of uh they are stifled ourselves our days so much yeah so will this with all this intro to today's sermon i am thankful after all we are finishing the book of judges today all right verse 13 and 14. then the whole assembly sent an offer of peace to the benzomides at the rock of women so the benjamites returned at the time back home and were given the women of jewish gilead who had been spared but there were not enough for all of them so those 600 benjamins those guys males you know they were locked up in the natural fortress called the rock of ribbon for four months four months after after the civil war and they are now set free from their exile and they are allowed to go back home uh to the territory of benjamin and then now they are allowed to start rebuilding the tribe the territory for the tribe was there but the population was the problem population now was now only 600 people and there was that 600 people was not a mixture of men and women and children families but only guys only guys 600 guys that's it for the tribal benjamin they were unable to populate their empty land no matter how much land was given no matter how much time was given they were unable without women those guys would not would just get old and old and die out right the whole tribe will die out extinction so the israelites obtained the 400 the rest of the the 11 tribes the rest of israelites they obtained the 400 virgin women by killing all males and married women in the entire city of jeremiah gilead as we read from the previous passage and it was another barbaric act so 400 virgin women they obtained that way so can you imagine really that they needed women virgin women for those of benjamin guys right so they entered into this city and then go into into into a house and then there's a husband and wife and then a young daughter and then a younger uh younger younger uh was that a son like that and then their grandparents like they'll go there and then kill everybody you so grandparents you're told go or you you already you know your grandma you already got married and then your wife uh mom you are already married so die and you father your man die and then young young daughters oh you're a virgin girl you leave and then the son you your male die they do that to james gilliard that's terrible yeah the entire city and they gleaned 400 virgin women to give to those benjaminite guys terrible book not terrible the word of god is the bible it's not a book but i mean book of judges really yeah but there was still 200 more 200 more guys who would who would age and die out without producing offspring so the verses 15 to 17 the people grieved for benjamin because the lord had made a gap in the tribes of israel 16 and the elders of the the assembly said well with the women of benjamin destroy destroyed how shall we provide wives for the man who are left 17. the benjaminite survivors must have heirs as they said so that a tribe of israel will not be wiped out very interesting verse 15 the writer of the of judges is saying it was the lord who had made a gap in the tribes of israel really wasn't it wasn't it due to the foolish act of israelites that one tribe almost uh disappeared was god responsible for that so here's the explanation whatever we do wise or foolish whatever israelites did whatever wise or foolish even today whatever we do wise or foolish god also does something all the time he's doing something so when you made that terrible mistake and you really messed really messed it up god was doing something then as well even after that even now god is doing something god is doing something all the time when you are doing something and god's part of course god's doing is always wise and good and his part can be comforting us inspiring us or guiding us judging us teaching us disciplining us or punishing us etc those are what god does while we are doing our thing in israel's case it was god's judgment that one tribe was almost annihilated and perhaps it was also because of god's intervention that at least 600 guys survived from the tribe of benjamin verse 18 we can't give them our daughters as wives since we israelites have taken this oath cursed be anyone who gives a wife to a benzomide we cannot give our dollars to the benzomides because we made this oath it sounds very familiar same thing again honoring their foolish vows instead of repenting of their rash behavior and seeking the lord's guidance if you messed up the past just quickly confess your violation to god god oh i just i did something stupid really god i'm so sorry quickly say that to god confess and then ask him what's the what is the next right thing to do that's it and do it turn to the right direction but these israelites didn't do that they kept devising another plan another plan to get out of their trouble their own way their own way they kept devising another plan yet another plan in their own way instead of asking god god what is the writing to do we just messed up really so sorry what is the next writing to do that i will follow you no israel failed why they didn't have a king they didn't have a king and they would not recognize the king's way then they were left with their own way so when we refuse god's way then we are left with our own way same thing again they depended on their own understanding and came up with another cool idea brilliant idea to get out of the trouble that's verse 19 but look there is the the annual festival of the lord in shiloh to the north of bethel and east of the road that goes from bethel to shechem and to the south of lebona look i have a great idea to get around uh in this conversation um yeah here verses uh um 15 yeah verses 15 to 19. these uh these elders of israel they're they're having this conversation conversation oh we are in trouble what should we do and then oh look i have an idea you know this is a whole conversation there how much better how much better could could it have been if they had just sat quietly and tried to look at the situation from god's perspective what is god doing in this situation okay okay hey elder way leader of israel let's let's let's quiet a little bit let's listen to god or let's look at this whole situation from god's perspective what is the lord doing what is the lord teaching to us what does he want us to do he is all-powerful and infinitely wise he is the one who brought us out of egypt he led us all the way from the land of slavery to this land promised land flowing milk and honey where is he leading us to now yeah we messed up really what is the next right thing to do let's listen let's just sit quietly and listen to him how much better really look at that yeah helping i think that is that is what disciples do on a daily basis yearly weekly monthly every day i think when we do qt when we meditate on god's word and make an application we listen to god god how shall i apply this to my life today to make it a better day than yesterday the more you do this the more you sit and listen to god and seek god's perspective try to look at the situation from god's perspective and seek what is right in god's eyes the more you do that the more ability you will develop to interpret life correctly and do the right thing in the eyes of god without fear of man the more you do this it's a very very powerful and healthy spiritual exercise and contrast that kind of quiet meditation before the lord and this anxious chat between the elders of israel here what kind of life resembles your life more verses 20 to 22 so they instructed the benjamins saying now they came up with this brilliant idea terrible idea so they instructed the benjamites those 200 guys right saying go and hide in the vineyards 21 and watch when the girls of shiloh come out to join in the dancing then rush from the vineyards and each of you sees a wife sees a wife that kind of phrase exists in history in the bible that is found in the bible sees a wife see the wife from the girls of shiloh and go to the land go go home yeah go go to your tribe but the land of benjamin verse 22 when the when their fathers or brothers of those girls complained to us what's this somebody kidnapped my daughter somebody killed my sister what was this and those bands are my guys who yeah if they complain to us then we will say to them please do also kindness by helping them because we did not get wives for them during the war we just killed all their women we just killed all their women benjamins so we are in trouble now we are going to lose one tribe so please yeah so we we we we deem you innocent okay don't worry about it even though your dollars were given to them okay since you did not give your dollars to them your daughters were taken right so the idea was to allow the benjamins benzema guys to kidnap girls from the dance dance festival the oath was dead actually yeah right nobody should give their dollars to the benjamins but if their daughters were taken or in this case kidnapped right kidnapped then it's not a violation of the oath yeah so they found or kind of created a loophole this way and such behavior is exactly what we do when we disregard the lord and lean on our own understanding or our misunderstanding the oath was their own idea right the oath was their own idea and the loophole they created was also their own idea to get around their own oath so those israelites were so encouraging inconsistent with themselves that's us really we are inconsistent not only with god but also with ourselves that's our life such an inconsistent being human beings trying to make sense of all that is happening in this world i mean how how can we how could we ever make sense of all these things that are happening in front of our eyes while we ourselves are so inconsistent and exactly that inconsistent that is why that's why we are so easily uh we get so easily surprised by accidents so many things are accidents well in god's eyes there is no extent right god is never surprised but we are so dismayed terrified by some accidents or we get so easily anxious by daily news reports how many people how many cases today ontario was used forty thousand within one day was something like i don't know i'd rather i don't follow that the tight life becomes complicated because of our inconsistency inconsistency but the solution is simple be consistent with god that's the solution how simple is that before you worry about your former oath israelites like oh because we made this oath we have to you know do something oh yeah oh what you have to do yeah i have an idea you know so before you you know yeah worry about your the that that foolish oath you made before before you worry about your mom's opinion or before you worry about tomorrow's uncertainty you know yeah what omicron is gonna do you know before you worry about those things think about what god is doing right now and follow him israel never learned this during the days of judges because they had no king they didn't consider god as their king without submitting to the kingship of the lord israel said happy new year to each other for 300 years 300 times without actually having a happy year that's what they did happy new year so instead of repenting those elders of israel said please save us from this embarrassing situation in the heat of the moment we just killed all women in the land of benjamin now we are subject to the blame if the tribal benjamin disappears so please help us save us from this embarrassing situation same thing again i don't know what month one month of the year this event took place in israel's history if it was the end of the uh at the end of the year then maybe you know the next the following week they probably said jonathan happy new year maybe oh thankfully now we probably found the 600 dollars for the benchmarks oh happy new year maybe they would say that isn't that what we are doing on the first day or first month of a new year verse 23 so that is what the benjamites did while the girls were dancing each man cut one and carried her off to be his wife then they returned to their inheritance and rebuilt the towns and settled in them wow guys would it be good if if uh if it was this easy to find a wife just go go to the farm and then there's a festival you know like a firework firework you know what's a special festival of like a very very harvest you know like that and then firework and girls yeah and just pick one yeah so back one you know don't take two it's one all right like that a no courtship how is it huh so that's what they did benjamins well yeah will we do ourselves now in 2022 today in in canada we'll do the same thing again in the new year israel let's do the same thing again and again every year yeah without knowing their king will we do the same thing again this year yeah well unfortunately most likely you know yes think about 2021 and 2020 compare them and 20 19. most likely yeah unless we make habit changes heavy changes so target your target heavy changes okay not your jacket change or house change or car change job change that they're all all good maybe necessary yeah but we always pray for the best job right but heavy change target heavy change so some means to happy changes uh can be scheduled change diet change workout change yeah well changing your dream from what well good life to fit for less or crunch but you know real some some practical change here could be helpful and most of all engage the community your discipler or your friends do some things together like that accountability and always depending on god until we ourselves are changed we are basically continue the same things again in the new year i guarantee you will do the same thing again in the new year until you yourself change until you change your habits we will have the same kind of year same kind of year like last year if we don't change and grow are you going to be more mature this new year are you going to be more mature what are your plans to grow in emotional maturity financial maturity physical maturity communication maturity really are do you have any plans to grow in your communication maturity do you have any plans i'm sure that the all the stress and frustration of the entire year 2021 would have been reduced by 50 if we had communicated better more than 50 it would have been far better if we had communicated better if we had communicated a timely manner communicated with courage and honesty without lying communicated with better phrases communicated with better facial expressions and simply communicated instead of being silent perhaps even even now at this very moment there could be someone here who needs to communicate yet staying silent make some changes for a better year don't repeat the same old again and again and expecting a happy new year last verse verse 24 second last at the time the israelites loved that place and went home to their tribes and clans each to his own inheritance and the 25 last verse in those days israel had no king israel had no king everyone did as he saw fit that's the conclusion of the book don't let that be your conclusion at the end of this year december 31st 2022 don't let that be your conclusion really israel continued the same thing until they had a king and we will all do the same thing also until the kingdom of god comes in our life we pray thy kingdom come thy kingdom come right how does the kingdom of god come into our life come to us when we submit to the king when we submit to the king same as israel when we have king jesus when we have a king in our life we will stop doing as we see fit but we will do as the king sees fit that is what it means to submit to the kingship to the king right the king is so huge we we are in complete surrender complete submission to the king so whatever decision we make whatever choice we make we always think what does the kings think right that is what it means to acknowledge god or christ as our king then we will always seek what is fit in the king's eyes and let that be your daily new habit in this new year 2022 let's pray lord yes we have we have heard this kind of message many times in the past again and again but let this with the same message let's let this new year become different because we actually submit to you and decide to obey you and learn to depend on you rely on your resources let us let us really learn that that art of relying on god's resources your spirit your strength your faithfulness your peace your provision and your help in temptation let us experience that this year so that we will end up being really happy and this year may end up being a happier and the new year's wish turns out to be really true comes true thank you lord please lead us in that path this year in jesus name we pray amen you
